Google Analytics server-side PHP

Please note that I have no affiliation with Google or Google Analytics or any other Google products or services.

This package was created as a means to learn how to send server-side data to Google Analytics to match up with client-side data, in order to pair transactions that occur in the back-end with users registered in the front-end.

This is a learning exercise and not meant for distribution so don't expect perfection.
